*A script that will automatically harvest points on the danish math website EMat*

## How to install

> Note that EMatDystenBot is currently only available for Windows. Mac and Linux support are in development.

2. Download the source code from the newest release.
3. Unzip the source code.

## How to use

1. Open the `start.bat` file, found in the source code folder.

2. Log into the website and go to the [harvesting site](https://contera.dk/tabel/dysten/start.aspx). You can do this by following the link or navigating through the menus of the website. (emat-dysten -> start emat-dysten -> start normal)
3. Go to the Powershell window and press any key.
4. Return to your browser, either by alt+tab or simply clicking on the browser window.
5. When the countdown hits zero (and you've returned to your browser), your computer should start working on it's own.
6. To stop the bot, close the Powershell window with your mouse, or use alt+f4.
