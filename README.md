# EMatDystenBot
*A program that automatically harvests points for the 'EMat Dysten' on the danish math website EMat.dk*

## Disclaimer & Terms of Use

EMatDystenBot does not break any terms nor rules of EMat, and is completely legal to use - but - even though it is not against the rules of EMat, you are still in the risk of potentially being excluded from the contest (or maybe even the whole website).

Therefore, I do not take any responsibility for your use of my program, nor do I take responsibility if you get excluded or banished from the website or contest because of it.

## How to install

> Note that EMatDystenBot is currently only available for Windows. Mac and Linux support are in development.

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sv3ks/EMatDystenBot/releases)
2. Download the source code from the newest release.
3. Unzip the source code.

## How to use

1. Open the `start.bat` file, found in the source code folder.
> After this step a Powershell window should show. Note that this is meant to happen, and you should not close the window if you want to use this bot.
2. Log into the website and open the console in the newly opened devtools sidebar or window.
3. Go to the Powershell window and press any key.
4. Return to your browser, either by alt+tab or simply clicking on the browser window. Make sure the console is selected. (If not, click on it)
5. When the countdown hits zero (and you've returned to your browser), your computer should start working on it's own.
6. To stop the bot, close the Powershell window with your mouse, or use alt+f4.

## How to fix

1. The console is not opening. This is caused by your computer using special `F12` features. In most cases, the fix is simply to change it in your hardware's app (OMEN Gaming Hub, Lenovo Vantage, etc. - this is depending on the hardware). Since this is hardware dependent, there is not 1 solution.
2. The console opens, but it doesn't automatically start typing in it. Solution: click on the console window.
